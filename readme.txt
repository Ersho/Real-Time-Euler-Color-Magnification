## Euler Video Magnification

Here I introduce my approach to introduce real time Euler Video Magnification

Output of EVM is little noisy but it is expected as this approach is little noisy generally. 
To increase amplification accuracy more you can increase backward_frame calculation rate, but
it will decrease FPS.

For more explanation of the project visit http://people.csail.mit.edu/mrub/evm/

This project is under development. 

Real time motion amplification is also included. But is has poor real time computation
so I leave it only for testing, it cannot be used for anything serious.

Have fun.
